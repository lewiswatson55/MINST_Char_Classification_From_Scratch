# MNIST Character Classification Model From Scratch

This is a simple MNIST character classification model from scratch. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and is able to classify handwritten digits with an accuracy of â‰ˆ92%.

This model was made to help me learn how to build a neural network from scratch and better understand forward and back propagation. A large portion of the code was inspired by [this](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wwsalmon/simple-mnist-nn-from-scratch-numpy-no-tf-keras) Kaggle post by Samson Zhang. However, I have made some changes to the code to improve it (hopefully) and to better understand the code.
